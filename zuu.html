          <p class="bodytext"> For my summer internship at ZUU Online Singapore, I was mainly responsible for rebranding the startup’s business cards, media kits and banners and creating electronic newsletters that would reach thousands of clients over email. As this was my first internship, I not only learned a lot about design, branding and front end development but also about working in a professional environment and understanding client needs. I believe that the experiences I gained will only allow me to further excel in future pursuits.
          </p>

          <p class="bodytitle">Rebranding</p>

          <p class="bodytext"> The startup's main focus is to educate consumers on the fintech market and encourage stakeholders to wisely invest. ZUU understands that finance can be difficult and possibly intimidating for the layman user; thus, in rebranding, I wanted to reflect upon this goal and give ZUU a professional but approachable appearance.

        <div class="projectblock">
          <p class="bodytext">
ZUU had already established the two red shades above as company colors before I came. When I looked at their old designs, I thought that the use of only white as a background color made for good contrast, but seemed a little bit plain. Thus, I introduced the two shades of grey-blue to offset this harshness and make company material look more modern.

          <div class="projectblock">
            <p class="bodytitle">ZUU Media Kit</p>
            <p class="bodytext">
              The Media Kit was my last project and the one I was most proud of for it challenged me to clearly understand the client’s needs. I made several iterations of the media kit until my boss approved of the version shown below. I made the cover red to represent the company colors and the inner pages the grey-blue shown above to make white elements pop and give the media kit a modern appearance.
              <br><br>
            Inside, there is information regarding the company’s mission, strengths, services, partnerships, ad placements, impact and contact information. As the media kit is targeted towards new potential business partners, I wanted to keep these pieces of information concise and aid them with visual cues. In this way, information between ZUU and its potential partners will be more transparent and the media kit will be more eye-catching and memorable.<br><br>

            <p class="bodytitle">Other Work</p>
            <p class="bodytext">During the summer I did other tasks which allowed me to apply
            design with marketing techniques. For example (shown below), I made an electronic newsletter, redesigned the business cards and created a banner for InvestFair 2017.
            <br><br>
            For the banner, I coined the phrase "ZUUM Into View", implementing an optometrist-inspired motif to play on the word "view" all the while holding together the brand identity through the colors and artistic style. The electronic newsletter was sent to thousands of subscribers, encouraged clients to check out our website and ultimately inspired my interest in web-design coding. For the business card, a simple redesign allowed the person's name to become the primary focus and the elimination of unecessary white space made information clearer (new one on bottom). <br><br>
