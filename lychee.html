          <p class="bodytext">This fall semester, I am working in a team of four to create the UX/UI for a prototype application that would help Chinese International students at Cornell University better acclimate to American culture.</p>

          <p class="bodytitle">Collecting Qualitative Data</p>
        </div>

        <div class="projectblock">
          <p class="bodytext">We started the project by creating a structured interview protocol that would gather basic demographic information and concerns of the interviewee and allow us to empathize with the interviewees’ social experiences on campus. We then extracted qualitative data from four interviews and later organized all that information into an affinity diagram (shown below).<br><br></p>
        </div>

        <div class="projectblock">
          <img src="images/affinitydiagram.png" alt="affinitydiagram"><br><br>
          <p class="bodytext">From this exercise, we noted key data points shared amongst all interviewees:
          <br><br></p>
          <p class="indenttext">
            1. The people we interviewed learned English prior to coming to Cornell; however, they all feel more comfortable speaking in their Mother Tongue. <br><br>

            2. These students have a strong focus on their academics and future careers. However, they feel that they don’t have the same opportunities an American student would have.  <br><br>

            3. All of them have had experiences with joining clubs on campus that promote the Asian or International Asian identity. <br><br>

            4. Communication between friends differs depending on who they are talking to; specifically, they speak in Chinese through WeChat when talking to Chinese friends and they speak in English through Facebook Messenger when talking to American friends.<br><br>

            5. They recognize that there exist stark differences between Chinese and American culture that sometimes makes them feel separated/different from their American peers.</p><br>
          <p class="bodytext">
Based upon these points, we created a persona, Yu Xuan Li, that would effectively represent our target demographic:

          <p class="bodytitle">Creating User-Centered Insights</p>
          <p class="bodytext">Having developed a strong understanding of Yu Xuan and our four interviewees’ experiences, we started to truly empathize with their concerns. The core problem that constituents in our target demographic share is that they have difficulty establishing a strong, diverse social/professional network at Cornell University. To find the root cause of this problem, we went ahead and asked a series of “why”’s:<br><br>
Core Problem: International Chinese students have a hard time building a well-connected social/professional network at Cornell University.  <br><br></p>
          <p class="indenttext">
            1. Why? Because they feel distant from other groups on campus <br><br>

            2. Why? Because they don’t feel as comfortable using English when public speaking, sharing ideas in meetings or interviewing with a company/on-campus club. <br><br>

            3. Because Chinese is their first language and they use Chinese more often in their daily lives. <br><br>

            4. Why? Because they haven’t had a lot of opportunities to practice their English in more casual settings (outside of the classroom). <br><br>

            5. <strong>Why? Because they learned English in a formal setting and thus don’t have a strong grasp on casual, conversational English and common American conversation topics that many young, American students know.
</strong></p><br>

            <p class="bodytext">By asking “why” consecutively, we were able to uncover a root problem and brainstorm products that would help to solve this problem. After coming up with 20 ideas each, the group decided to create an application that would help Chinese International students learn American slang/pop culture so they can know how to engage in conversation with their American peers better.</p>

            <p class="bodytitle">Designing the Application Prototype</p>

            <p class="bodytext">Taking all the aforementioned insights, my group and I created the first iteration of our prototype: a low fidelity, pdf prototype made with Balsamiq. Our first prototype provides structured lessons on American slang, conversation topics and pop culture references. In addition, the app offers a dictionary search feature for on-the-go use, opportunities to practice learned material with an AI chatting system and flexibility to change account settings after onboarding.</p><br><br>

            <a href="lychee_mockup.pdf">Click Here To View the Balsamiq Prototype</a><br><br>

            <p class="bodytext">For our next step, we will conduct user testing with this low fidelity prototype and conduct heuristic evaluations (Nielsen's Heuristics). Once we gather information from both procedures, we will reiterate our design and create a higher-fidelity prototype using Sketch and InVision. In addition, we will refine the application's brand identity and create a UI kit. Stay tuned for the rest of the project! </p>
