        <div class="projecttext">
          Lychee is an application that helps Chinese international students better understand American slang and humor. I, along with three other designers, came up with this fully functional prototype to help Chinese International students better adjust to Cornell’s campus and interact with American peers. To achieve this solution, we first discovered a core problem based on user interviews and used this qualitative data to develop prototypes, make iterations based on feedback and eventually use prototyping tools to bring it all to life.

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="projecttext">
          We wrote out a structured interview protocol and interviewed 4 students. We gathered basic demographic information and asked them about their social experiences at Cornell. We found that:
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <ol class="projecttextlist">
          <li>All have exposure to English speaking environments prior to coming to Cornell but still feel more comfortable talking to Chinese peers and using their mother tongue.</li>
          <li>Communication styles and mediums differ based on who they talk to; they primarily used FB Messenger to talk to Americans and WeChat to talk to fellow Chinese students.</li>
          <li>Cultural barriers, discrimination and clique tendencies make it more difficult for theses students to develop closer relationships with American peers.</li>
          <li>There are resources to help these students but they are not well promoted or inaccessible to some.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="projecttext">
          The core problem is that while these students have learned English in academic settings, they are not fully comfortable using English colloquially and are not sure what to talk about with American students. After each member brainstormed 20 possible solutions, we thought the best way to address this problem would be to create an application that would help these students learn American slang, humor and pop culture references.

        <p class="projectsectiontitle">Looking Into Solution Space</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="projecttext">
          To further develop this idea, we looked at similar, existing solutions. For example, an application, Slang, helps native Spanish speakers learn business/professional terminology in English. We also looked at products that aren't digital but target a relevant, core problem. For example, Cornell offers a Cornell-China program in which prospective students from China can immerse themselves into the US and the Cornell campus for a summer. While building off of these, to better tailor our solution we:

        <ol class="projecttextlist">
        <li>Ideated ways in which students can apply what they learned on the app</li>
        <li>Decided to make the application mobile as our target audience often uses digital platforms for communication and learning.</li>

        <div class="projecttext">
          To best prepare our users for casual conversations with American students, we came up with the following three key features:
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <ol class="projecttextlist">
          <li>Lessons: the main focus of the application, users should be able to learn through lessons and evaluate their progress through quizzes.</li>
          <li>Dictionary: users should be able to refer to a convenient source for words and phrases without having to go through entire lessons.</li>
          <li>AI Chatting: users should be able to chat with an American student AI to apply what they learn without the stress of messing up in real life interactions.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="projecttext">
          As shown in the video above, for our first round of user testing, we focused on creating tasks for the login/registration process, going through a lesson, looking up a word in the dictionary, chatting with an AI and adjusting user settings.

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="projecttext">
          Using these tasks, we conducted user testing with four more Chinese international students. While most points were made in direct relation to tasks given, our users also gave feedback for new features. The following summarizes our insights across all tests:

        <div class="projecttext">
          Things that Worked:
        </div>

        <ol class="projecttextlist">
        <li>Lesson structure and flow is intuitive and effective.</li>
          <li>Searching words in dictionary is super easy; moreover, favorite words feature makes memorizing more commonly used words easier.</li>
          <li>Login process is very easy and quick</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="projecttext">
          Things to Improve On:
        </div>

        <ol class="projecttextlist">
          <li>Locking lessons prevents users from skipping material that they already know.</li>
          <li>Registration could be simplified (suggested connecting to existing social media account).</li>
          <li>System language can only be changed in app, not during onboarding.</li>
          <li>Icons in navigation bar aren’t super clear (folder and magnifying glass especially).</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p class="projectsectiontitle">Making Improvements Part 1: Onboarding</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="projecttext">
          Since a significant majority of our target audience uses WeChat, we decided it would be helpful to allow users to either login with a username or WeChat account. When clicking WeChat, users will be given to option to continue with login or register with WeChat if they do not have a preexisting accounted linked. Furthermore, we added “go back” buttons in both login sequences to improve error recovery.
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="projecttext">
          In addition, we added an option to take a placement test during the registration process so more advanced users can start learning at a suitable level. Placement test is accessible in both onboarding sequences (right after registration completes).

        <p class="projectsectiontitle">Making Improvements Part 2: Chatting</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="projecttext">
          Users thought that talking to an AI could be awkward so we designed an option to talk with either a real user or AI. The entry point for both are represented by separate buttons found on the main messaging page. Next to the chat participant’s name is (AI) or (User) to visually differentiate the two.
