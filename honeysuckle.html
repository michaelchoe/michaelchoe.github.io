            I worked with a team to create a technological solution for patients suffering from sickle cell anemia. We decided we should create an application that offers patients a community, reliable and quick access to information and convenient contact with health-care professionals. We called our finished product Honeysuckle. Below, I will talk about the design process.

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <p class="projectsectiontitle">Understanding our Users</p>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <p class="projecttext">While we did not have the resources to conduct proper user interviews/testing, we extrapolated insights from articles and analyzed data collected by OHG (and other online sources) to outline the following key points: </p>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <ol class="projecttextlist">
            <li>Sickle cell patients express that it’s hard to find the right doctors.</li>
            <li>A majority of health care professionals express that they don’t have a firm grasp of sickle cell anemia and are unsure of how to treat patients perfectly.</li>
            <li>Over 75% of our target audience has access to or owns a smartphone.</li>
            <li>Over half of sickle cell patients make $40k or less annually; many patients might be unable to afford frequent hospital visits.</li>
            <li>Patients are not able to predict the pain they will go through each day. Sometimes there is no pain and sometimes the pain is so bad that they need to be rushed to the hospital.</li>
            <li>Common medications that sickle cell patients take are Hydroxyurea, Advil and Folate.</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <p class="projecttext">To address these concerns, we wanted to create an application that would allow users a way to keep track of a patient's health and provide a community for sickle cell patients and those around them. We then strategized five core features of the application as listed below:</p>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <ol class="projecttextlist">
            <li>Health Tracking: users should be able to monitor and keep record of their own or a patient's health status.</li>
            <li>Onboarding: as there are three key players in the sickle cell community (patients, caregivers and health care professionals) the onboarding experience should account for that.</li>
            <li>Discussion: users should be able to find relevant information, ask questions, share stories and ultimately build community through this application.</li>
            <li>Messaging: users should be able to converse with other users to form bonds and get access to better medical advice.</li>
            <li>Accounts and Profiles: users should be able to adjust account settings as well as interact with other users' profiles.</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <p class="projectsectiontitle">Tracking and Sharing Health Status</p>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <p class="projecttext">One of the primary features we wanted to implement in this application was a way in which a patient’s health can be tracked (either by patient or caregiver) and easily shared with others. This feature allows users to log key information daily: pain level, dosage of medications taken and, if needed, special notes. This will help users understand the trends of a patient’s condition better; if these records are shared with a healthcare professional, then the HCP can better keep up with and diagnose his/her patient. There is also an option for users to share just one record or all records; for example, users can either share one record to ask a simple question or share all records to maintain a consistent relationship with a HCP they trust. </p>

        <div class="projecttextcontainer">

          <p class="projectsectiontitle">Onboarding Experience</p>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <p class="projecttext">Besides the necessary login credentials, we wanted onboarding users to provide additional information: 1) whether they are a patient, caregiver or health care professional 2) their age 3) their location. We thought it would be important to differentiate users so that users can interact with others knowing what they can get out of that interaction (ex: patient knows to contact user tagged “HCP” to find medical help). Age is important especially for patients so that HCP can better understand the physiology of their patients. Finally, we hope that through this application patients can find doctors more easily; thus, location is essential so that they can find doctors nearby. </p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="projecttextcontainer">

          <p class="projectsectiontitle">Homepage Interactions: Discussion and Search</p>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <p class="projecttext">Through discussions, users can ask questions, share stories, find new information about sickle cell disease and find community. We thought that adding a forum would be extremely important for a few reasons: 1) health care professionals can have more personal insight into the lives of sickle cell patients and develop more empathy 2) sharing relevant information and experiences in a community setting benefits everyone going through the same troubles 3) patients and caregivers do not have to feel like they are the only ones suffering. Users can publish their own posts and comment on others'.</p>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <p class="projecttext">With the search bar, users can search for discussion posts or other users (search results are differentiated). This not only makes information more accessible but also allows users to contact other people on the platform more easily (especially HCP).</p>

        <div class="projecttextcontainer">

          <p class="projectsectiontitle">Messaging Other Users</p>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <p class="projecttext">Implementing messaging functionality would allow users to keep in touch with doctors; this especially helps those who are unable to afford frequent hospital visits or those who are not in close distance to sickle-cell specialists. Users can also message other patients and caregivers to form relationships and share their experiences/advice. As shown earlier, users can share their health records with other users; this feature is also accessible through the chatroom to make things more convenient. </p>

        <div class="projecttextcontainer">

          <p class="projectsectiontitle">User Profile and Settings</p>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <p class="projecttext">From this page, users can see the posts they have contributed to the forum and also access the settings page. The “my posts page” serves as a record but also an entry point to write a new post; users should not have to go all the way back to home to write one if they need to (this minimizes click and increases ease of use). In the settings page, users can change their full name, username, password, location and bio. While during onboarding users were asked to fill out their birthdate and user type, it is very unlikely or impossible for these attributes to change so including them in settings is redundant. The other qualities can change with events such as moving, marriage, current state of mind, etc.  </p>
