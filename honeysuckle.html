            I worked with a team to create a technological solution for patients suffering from sickle cell anemia. We decided we should create an application that offers patients a community, reliable and quick access to information and convenient contact with health-care professionals. We called our finished product Honeysuckle. Below, I will talk about the brand design, presentation design and UI and strategy for the prototype application that we made.

          <p class="projectsectiontitle">Understanding our Users</p>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <p class="projecttext">While we did not have the resources to conduct proper user interviews/testing, we read articles and analyzed data collected by OHG (and other online sources) and came up with the following key points: </p>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <ol class="projecttextlist">
            <li>Sickle cell patients express that it’s hard to find the right doctors.</li>
            <li>A majority of health care professionals express that they don’t have a firm grasp of sickle cell anemia and are unsure of how to treat patients perfectly.</li>
            <li>Over half of sickle cell patients make $40k or less annually; many patients might be unable to afford frequent hospital visits.</li>
            <li>Patients are not able to predict the pain they will go through each day. Sometimes there is no pain and sometimes the pain is so bad that they need to be rushed to the hospital</li>
            <li>Common medications that sickle cell patients take are Hydroxyurea, Advil and Folate.</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <p class="projecttext">Based on these findings, we implemented a strategy and basic UX for the application prototype as explained below. We wanted the application to not allow users a way to keep track of a patient's health but also provide a community for sickle cell patients and those around them.</p>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <p class="projectsectiontitle">Tracking and Sharing Health Status</p>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <p class="projecttext">One of the primary features we wanted to implement in this application was a way in which a patient’s health can be tracked (either by patient or caregiver) and easily shared with others. This feature allows users to log key information daily: pain level, dosage of medications taken and, if needed, special notes. This will help users understand the trends of a patient’s condition better; if these records are shared with a healthcare professional, then the HCP can better keep up with and diagnose his/her patient. </p>

          <p class="projectsectiontitle">Onboarding Experience</p>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <p class="projecttext">Besides the necessary login credentials, we wanted onboarding users to provide additional information: 1) whether they are a patient, caregiver or health care professional 2) their age 3) their location. We thought it would be important to differentiate users so that users can interact with others knowing what they can get out of that interaction (ex: patient knows to contact user tagged “HCP” to find medical help). Age is important especially for patients so that HCP can better understand the physiology of their patients. Finally, we hope that through this application patients can find doctors more easily; thus, location is essential so that they can find doctors nearby. </p>

          <p class="projectsectiontitle">Participating in Discussions</p>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <p class="projecttext">Through discussions, users can ask questions, share stories, find new information about sickle cell disease and find community. We thought that adding a forum would be extremely important for a few reasons: 1) health care professionals can have more personal insight into the lives of sickle cell patients and develop more empathy 2) sharing relevant information and experiences in a community setting benefits everyone going through the same troubles 3) patients and caregivers do not have to feel like they are the only ones suffering. </p>
